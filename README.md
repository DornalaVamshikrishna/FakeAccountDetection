# FakeAccountDetection
This aim of the project is to build and train a deep neural network model to detect fake or spam instagram accounts.   This model is trained such that it considers few features and determines whether a particular account is fake or not. By resulting the output as either 0 or 1 meaning TRUSTED or FAKE respectively. We intend to make this software capable of thinking like a human, based on the data it is given and results in the maximum probability of success.   The tools used in this project are the python packages Numpy and Pandas, and to visualize and explore the data: Matplotlib, Seaborn. Tensorflow and keras for creating the model.
